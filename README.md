## Simple Vulkan Renderer

The architecture and many codes mimic the Piccolo engine, https://github.com/BoomingTech/Piccolo

Part of the code is from my project VulkanThreadPool, https://github.com/F-Mu/VulkanThreadPool

Part of the code is from this project,https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan

**NOW:**

+ Simple rasterization

+ Simple ray-tracing

+ gltf model loading

+ CSM+PCF

**TODO:**

+ Provide scene and object loading

+ Provide UI

+ Separate normal Vulkan device and ray-tracing Vulkan device

+ Implement different types of cameras 

+ More render passes after learning more graphics knowledge

+ ~~Become a game engine,having editor mode and game mode~~

+ AO
